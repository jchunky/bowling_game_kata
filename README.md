Bowling Kata in Ruby
========================
This kata is meant to hone skills in ruby and improve skill in Test Driven Development.

## Installation
1. Install gems `bundle install`
1. Run specs `rspec spec`

## Uncle Bob's Rules to TDD
1. Write no production code, except to pass a failing test
1. Write only enough of a test to demonstrate failure
1. Write only enough production code to pass a test
1. (Not actually one of the rules) Refactor the code

## Red-Green-Refactor
Use the Red-Green-Refactor cycle to:
1. Start with a red test
1. Implement the production code to make the test green with the least amount of code possible
1. Refactor the code

## Instructions
Use Uncle Bob's rules in conjunction with Red/Green/Refactor to incrementally implement the bowling game class.

1. Implement code to get the current red test to green
1. Refactor code as necessary
1. Add new tests using Arrange-Act-Assert to guide implementing new functionality
1. Use the state of the tests to evaluate the design and test of code.
